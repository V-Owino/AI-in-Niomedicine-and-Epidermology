AI is transforming the practice of medicine. It’s helping doctors diagnose patients more accurately, make predictions about patients’ future health, and recommend better treatments.in this Repo, I will share  practical experience applying machine learning to concrete problems in medicine like:
##Diagnose diseases from x-rays and 3D MRI brain images 
##Predict patient survival rates more accurately using tree-based models
##Estimate treatment effects on patients using data from randomized trials 
##Automate the task of labeling medical datasets using natural language processing
